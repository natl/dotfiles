# My dotfiles

Feel free to copy anything from here, this is just my setup, and I've taken inspiration from many others.

## Installation

* fork this to your account
* clone the new repo
* change the names, emails, etc in install.sh
* run install.sh (**Important** cd into this directory before running install.sh)
* if you want to install some packages I find useful, run install.sh with the -p option
* any dotfiles that would be overwritten will be placed in old-dotfiles/ (note that running the script for a second time will delete the dotfiles in old-dotfiles)
* enjoy!
