# My dotfiles

Feel free to copy anything from here, this is just my setup, and I've taken inspiration from many others.

## Installation

* fork this to your account
* clone the new repo
* change the names, emails, etc in install.sh
* run /install.sh
* any dotfiles that would be overwritten will be placed in old-dotfiles/
* enjoy!
